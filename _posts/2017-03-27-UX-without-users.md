* Jessican DuVerneay is coming April 5
* Stats Bootcamp on Wednesday with Xi

# New Stuff: Walkthroughs

Evaluate and investigate the interface without asking users to do anything.

## Heuristic Evaluations

Primary benefit: Quick and dirty for uncovering lots of UX issues

1. Choose the heuristics
	1. [Nielsen's heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) 
	2. [Perlman's heuristics](http://garyperlman.com/quest/quest.cgi?form=PHUE)
2. Choose/train the inspectors
3. Prepare task descriptions
4. Run the evaluation

### HE Data Collection
|Location in the Task Description | Heuristic Violated | UX Defect Description | Inspectors' Comments | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Locate event details | Flexibility and efficiency | Events is hidden behind hamburger menu | Could users choose events over live on their menus? Or top menu? Need to know whether "events" is more commonly used, better engagement than existing menu items | Low |

### HE Report

| Heuristic | Score | Comments|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visibility of system status | | |
| Match between system and real world | | |
| User control and freedom | | |
| Consistency and standards | | |
| Error prevention | | |
| Recognition rather than recall | | |
| Flexibility and efficiency of use | | |
| Aesthetic and minimalist design | | |
| Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | | |
| Help and documentation | | |

## Cognitive Walkthroughs

Primary benefit: evaluate ease of learning

1. Define the users
2. Determine tasks appropriate for walkthrough (e.g., for new users, new tasks)
3. Action sequences for each task
4. Get group of evaluators
5. Run evaluation

At each step, ask 4 questions (Wharton et al., 1994):

* Will the user try to achieve the right action?* Will the user notice that the correct action is available?* Will the user associate the correct action with the effect thatthe user is trying to achieve?* If the correct action is performed, will the user see that prog-ress is being made toward solution of the task?

Can you tell a _credible story_ at each point?

Story: How we explain that the user 
* Will understand the necessary step,* See that the action is available, * Recognize the available action,* Understand the feedback
Evidence: Reasoning behind our claim
* Experience* System info* Sees a label or device* Prompt* Process of elimination* System feedback

## Standards Evaluations

* Professional, legal (e.g., [ISO 9241](https://www.iso.org/standard/52075.html))
* Design (e.g., [Illinois Tech styleguide](https://web.iit.edu/marketing-communications/resources/editorial-style-guide))
* Accessibility (e.g., [508 Checker](http://www.508checker.com/))

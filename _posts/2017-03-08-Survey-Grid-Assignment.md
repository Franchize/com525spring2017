Every question on your survey should connect to you data and business goals. Writing out your questions ahead of time makes it easier to construct the survey when you're ready. Here's an example:

| Question  | Instructions   | Answers  | Reasons  |  Goals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What is your age?  |  None  |  Text box with number validation  |  Stop underage respondents, compare with assumptions about user base |  #1 - See if our users are who we think they are |

You must construct a grid that includes all the questions you'll ask, and you must fill out all 5 columns for each question.

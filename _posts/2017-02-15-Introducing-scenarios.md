### Scenario	 
A scenario is a design input in the form of <b>a story</b> about <b>specific people</b> performing work activities in a specific work situation within a <b>specific work context</b>, told in a concrete <b>narrative style</b>, as if it were a transcript of a real usage occurrence. Scenarios are deliberately <b>informal</b>, <b>open-ended</b>, and <b>fragmentary</b> narrative depictions of <b>key usage situations</b> happening over time.

* short version: a narrative of how your persona(s) use your product.


### Goals - find the problem
Gain a better understanding of the system usage in the context of the userâ€™s actual experience.
	    
### Elements of scenarios:  
* User(s) (background, needs, goals)  
* User thoughts and user actions  
* System response  
* Context  
* Barriers   

e.g. on P. 221 & 222

# When do we use scenarios?

Scenarios can have a number of iterations and be utilised in a number of ways throughout the project life-cycle.

- In the beginning of a project to help flesh out requirements.
- Tools to explore design solutions.
- Validate designs and reveal design assumptions.
- Hang specifications and wire-frames off within documentation.
- Test the final designs.
- Competitor analysis to compare a variety of sites to each other.


# Scenario Planning

- Personas
- Contextual inquiry (semi-structured interview with users)
- Complains/reviews
- Customer-facing staff (ex. bus drivers, station staff, customer service operators)
- General guess


# How to Create a Scenario?

### Think & write  
- Users (background, needs, activities, reactions, thoughts, feelings)
- The context of use (environment & other)
- Tasks to be supported by the system (user's goals, your product features)
- Barriers (failure, upset, difficulties, etc.)

Think about questions:  
Who is the persona?  
What triggers this experience?  
What happens?  
What is the outcome?

### Review 
with UX team, with actual user

Ask questions:  
Is this story realistic?  
Is this story typical?  
Does this story cover the function you want to test? 


*keep your goals in mind.

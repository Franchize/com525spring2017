# Goals

I see some confusion about what particular kind of goals are important to consider before getting started. Especially when we're talking about a formal user test, we're talking about *business goals*. Useful business goals are those that describe a company's objectives or direction (see [a brief section in UX Magazine](http://uxpamagazine.org/aligning_ux_business_goals/)). Business goals are often expressed in terms of the business's performance measures such as amount of sales, number of users/subscribers, market position, etc. Business goals can be identified from many sources including strategic plans, capital pressues, some other business unit (e.g. customer service line), or another UX evaluation (e.g., server logs).

"Better UX" is not a business goal because it's not explictly tied to the business's objectives or direction (unless you are in the rare business that sees good UX as an end in itself). Usability or UX goals are usually in service of business goals (even competitive advantage).

# Research Questions

The most important thing that explicitly stating research questions accomplishes is *focus*. They articulate the purpose(s) of a particular UX activity and, in doing so, also articulate what's beyond the scope of the current activity. Research questions tell us what the test is for, what is it designed to teach us, and they connect to specific business  goals so that we can readily articulate *why* we're doing whatever activity or task we're doing.

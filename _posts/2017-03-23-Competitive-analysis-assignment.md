Your group must conduct a competitive analysis and report your results. The goals of competitive analysis are essentially two-fold:

1. Understand the conventions, standards in your space
2. Identify potential solutions to UX problems your system faces

Your analysis must include the following:

* list of competitors
* feature comparison table that includes at least 2 competitors 
* flow models for 
	* at least your system and 2 others 
	* on some set of features you care about (and why those features) 
* write up of takeaways from the comparison

When choosing the features to model and doing your write up of takeaways, keep in mind that you're trying to *solve UX challenges*. What challenges have you identified from your user tests and in developing personas? How do the competitors address them?

Remember, you can read about flow models (and other comparison techniques) in ch. 6 of *[The UX Book](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x5o2lh23ab4nadu/AAAC0KIkM53gxxy2SHM0x78-a/The%20UX%20Book%20Process%20and%20Guidelines.pdf?dl=0)*.

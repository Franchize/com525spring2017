# Administrivia

- See the [assignments]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments) page for updates about what's required for COM 381 vs COM 525
- Due date for user test report will be **Feb 22** - that gives you two weeks to run evaluations and write up reports

# New Stuff - Personas

Persona: a fictional person who represents a group of users

Features of personas:

- relevant to business goals
- based on data (or well-founded assumptions)
- inspiring for the design/development teams

## Persona Lifecycle

### Persona Family Planning

User research provides raw materials for personas

- existing internal data (ex. [CTA data from city](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-List-of-CTA-Datasets/pnau-cf66), [CTA's data about itself](http://www.transitchicago.com/ridership/))
- existing external data (ex. [RGA's study](https://metrarail.com/sites/default/files/assets/about-metra/2011custsatfinal_rta_regional_report_5_24_12_final.pdf))
- generate new external data (ex. [Tweets directed @CTA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zihBaus3usKJDRzvhOBnpwmYpbgWa0dFKX1y5RtWmmU/edit?usp=sharing), UX research)
- customer-facing staff (ex. bus drivers, station staff, customer service operators)

### Persona Conception and Gestation Process

1. Identify important categories of users
2. Use available data to find themes
3. Build skeletons based on those themes
4. Prioritize skeletons
5. Expand skeletons into personas
6. Validate the personas

### Other Phases

Phases 3 - 5 of personal lifecylce more about development than UX research, so beyond the scope of this class

Advice from persona designers for focusing your UX team:

1. What are the top three to five business goals for your product or service?
2. What are the top three to five brand goals for your product or service?
3. What are the top three to five user experience goals for your product or service?
4. What are the most important differentiators for your product or service?
5. What are the most important value propositions for your product or service?

# Ad Hoc Persona activity

2. Clarify business, brand, and UX goals
3. Categories of users
4. Assumption sticky notes
5. Sticky note assimilation

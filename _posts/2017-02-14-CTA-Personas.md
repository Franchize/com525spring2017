# Jimmy Winehouse
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jimmyw.jpg" height="150">

## Job
A 21 years old full-time college student.

## Role and short description
Hipster living in the Chicago suburb (Oak Park). 

## Short Narrative
Jimmy is a college student living in Oak Park, Chicago. He is fascinated with all old-fashion items. On a snowy weekend near the Christmas day, Jimmy Winehouse wants to go to Chicago downtown to make preparations for the holiday. He wanted to buy some craft beer and unique decorations stuff, and he chose to take CTA train as the transportation tool that day.

## Assumptions

* Jimmy avoids taking car to downtown because it’s a snowy day, it would be slippery to drive on the road and he didn’t want to take risk.
* Jimmy avoids taking car to downtown because it’s difficult to find a parking in Downtown on a busy weekend.
* CTA train has lots of stations and may detour, which may take a longer time. However, Jimmy’s time was flexible, and he was not in a hurry. He was not supposed to make the back and forth within a limited time.

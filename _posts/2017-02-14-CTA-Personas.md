# Jimmy Winehouse
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/jimmyw.jpg" height="150">

## Job
A 21 years old full-time college student.

## Role and short description
Hipster living in the Chicago suburb (Oak Park). 

## Short Narrative
Jimmy is a college student living in Oak Park, Chicago. He is fascinated with all old-fashion items. On a snowy weekend near the Christmas day, Jimmy Winehouse wants to go to Chicago downtown to make preparations for the holiday. He wanted to buy some craft beer and unique decorations stuff, and he chose to take CTA train as the transportation tool that day.

## Assumptions

* Jimmy avoids taking car to downtown because it’s a snowy day, it would be slippery to drive on the road and he didn’t want to take risk.
* Jimmy avoids taking car to downtown because it’s difficult to find a parking in Downtown on a busy weekend.
* CTA train has lots of stations and may detour, which may take a longer time. However, Jimmy’s time was flexible, and he was not in a hurry. He was not supposed to make the back and forth within a limited time.

##John Thims

###Personal Details

John Thims is a 49 year old software developer and a single father of a teenage girl.  He presently works at a tech startup at the Mart.  Almost fifteen years ago, he lost his wife and the use of his legs in a tragic car accident.  At the time, he and his family lived in Wyoming.  John and his wife were on their way to a parent-teacher conference at their daughter's school on the night of the accident.  As they pulled into the school's parking lot, a rabid grizely bear appeared out of nowhere.  John swerved into a light-post and sustained severe spinal injuries.  His wife, unscathed by the impact, was pulled out of the car by a second grizzly bear and carried into the woods, never to be seen or heard from again. [The school had no sentinals armed with high-powered munitions - shame on them.](https://twitter.com/libshipwreck/status/821793022807511043?lang=en) If you're not convinced that bears are the worst, [let Stephen Colbert sway your opinion](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/f0uh68/the-colbert-report-threatdown---all-bear-edition).  Shortly after the accident, John and his daughter relocated to Chicago because a massively underfunded public school system with chronically underpaid teachers is still better than one riddled by bears.  These days, John and his daughter live in a house in or around Fullerton.  John works at his job at the Mart Monday-Friday from 8am-5pm.  He likes to get home as soon as possible after work to have dinner with his daughter and to help her with her homework (if needed).  In his spare time, John is a contributing editor on bear-control issues at the [American Journal of Post-Factual Science](postfactualscience.com).

###Market Segment
Restricted mobility / requires assistance

###Job / Role
John is determined to live his life with the highest degree of autonomy possible.  As such, he would like to be able to traverse the CTA with no or minimal assistance.  This requires that the routes he take have accessible stations (as defined by ADA guidelines).

###Goal
John's goals are similar to those of most other commuters using the CTA, with some minor differences.  It's important to him that, along with getting from point-A to point-B in a timely fashion, he's actually able to gain entry to the stations and platforms along the fastest route.  Sometimes, lack of elevators or wheelchair accessible entry gates (sometimes found next to the turnstiles) means he has to find alternate routes.  Thus, he'd like to be able to always find the *fastest* route that is also *wheelchair-accessible* (and maybe, someday, to have the fastest route and the wheelchair accessible route be one in the same).

###Abilities, Skills, and Knowledge
* John has a good idea of where he needs to go and when he needs to get there 
* He has a firm grasp on the various CTA 'L' lines and the areas they travel to, and is able to navigate the 'L' as an adept.
* He knows at least some 'L' stations along his usual routes at which he's able to gain access with his wheelchair.
* Assuming he has his wheelchair, John is mobile and does not need assistance or someone to push him.
* He is tech savvy

###Data Sources and Assumptions
* John needs a wheelchair gate in order to gain access to 'L' stations.
* At stations with elevated or underground platforms, John needs either a ramp or an elevator in order to reach the platform.

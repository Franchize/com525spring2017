# Special Instructions for grad/undergrad sections

## 300-level students

Your report should be a single document (e.g, Google doc, PDF, Word) with all the pieces. It should be named something useful like "CTA Final UX Report". Xi and I are your audience.

## 500-level students

Your "report" should be a final version of your website. Your audience is the company that runs the system or service you evaluated. This project should be part of your portfolio, and you should be proud to show it to recruiters and hiring managers to show them what you can do.

# FAQ

## Can we change our previous reports?

Yes, please do. If you received less-than-stellar grade on an earlier assignment, update the evaluation and/or its report for your final report. Your final project grade depends on this report.

## What happened to evaluating our teammates?

I'm glad you asked. You can find the [form for team member evaluations on Google Forms - you must be logged in to your IIT Google Account](https://docs.google.com/a/iit.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTKKDH6CbX2SCD1pihtu4sNMz-Y8R6PjUotxQkFEVdJO07gA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Remember to complete one for each member of your group, including yourself.

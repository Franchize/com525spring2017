# Administrivia

## Review [Assignments]({{ base.url}}/assignments)

Remember, you're to setup a website as your deliverable. You should set that up today so that you can complete next week's assignment.

## Due Dates

- Your user test plan is due **Monday, Feb 6** *before class*. The required components of the plan are
	- goals
	- research questions
	- participant characteristics
	- test script (what will the moderator say)
	- task list
	- data and evaluation measures
- Your user test report is due **Monday, Feb 13** *before class*. See chapters 11-12 for tips on report writing. The audience for this report is the developers of the product/service you tested. Shoot for testing with 3-5 users. More is not necessarily better.

# Review

Share your research questions someone from another group. Are the questions

- precise
- accurate
- clear
- measurable (observable)?

# New Material

Xi has found [a few more scripts](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x5o2lh23ab4nadu/AAAZrt5No8iKRxjzCQt6Bgrea?dl=0) for you to use as examples. Your job today is to choose tasks for your test and draft a script. If there's time, you should trade with another group to pilot that script. 

- Do users understand the tasks? 
- Is the moderator's role clear? 
- Do your tasks get data that answers your research questions?

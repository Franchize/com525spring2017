# Due Date

Monday, April 3

# Details

You have all received comments on your [survey grids]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/03/Survey-Grid-Assignment/). Your next steps are to 

* adjust the survey questions, answers, instructions, and question order and create the actual survey
* [send me](mailto:lhemphil@iit.edu) a link to your survey 

Your classmates will serve as your pilot users for the survey. I will forward your survey to the class for people to take, and then we will talk about the surveys in class. 

After your classmates pilot the survey and give feedback, you may wish to make more changes to the survey. Once you are satisfied with the survey, you may "send it live" and start asking people in the world to take it. You should send me the survey again at this point so I can boost your signal into other social networks. Remember, you can use places like [/r/SampleSize](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/) when appropriate (read the sidebar) to recruit users for your survey.

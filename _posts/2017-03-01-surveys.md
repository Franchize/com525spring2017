# New Stuff - Surveys

Material from lecture comes from Chapter 11 (2003) or 12 (2012) of [*Observing the User Experience*](https://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/vf-iit/Record/iit_867928) by Mike Kuniavsky. The book is available online through the library. You should read the sections on analyzing data and writing up survey reports.

One of the biggest challenges of using surveys for UX is actually getting people to take your survey. UXBeginner has a [blog post](http://www.uxbeginner.com/how-to-get-people-to-fill-out-your-damn-ux-surveys/) specifically addressing this problem, so I won't deal with it here.

## Why Surveys

* big N
* learn about who your users are
* learn about what they want, think

## Examples of Types of Surveys

* profile
* satisfaction
* value
* pre-/post-test

## Examples of Question Types

* characteristic - demographics and technologies
* behavioral - web use, competitors
* attitudinal - satisfaction, preference, want

## Process for Writing a Survey
1. Start with goals
2. Every one on the team draft a list of questions
3. Whole team talk about the questions
4. Rewrite your questions in close-ended questions that offer specific, exhaustive, and mutually-exclusive answers
5. Draw up a survey grid (see below)
6. Write general instructions and build the survey online
7. Outline your survey report and see whether you can actually answer your questions. Repeat 2-6 until you can
8. Test survey with friendly population
9. Repeat 2-8 with new info from test

**Example Survey Grid**

| Question  | Instructions   | Answers  | Reasons  |  Goals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What is your age?  |  None  |  Text box with number validation  |  Stop underage respondents, compare with assumptions about user base |  #1 - See if our users are who we think they are |

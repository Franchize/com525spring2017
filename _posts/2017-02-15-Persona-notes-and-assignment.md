# Purposes of Personas

What benefits do personas provide? Well, mainly 3:

1. make the team's assumptions and knowledge about users explicit
2. help team focus on designing for specific users (who may not be like the team)
3. help team develop interest and empathy in the users

So, good personas are those that help us accomplish those three things. You heard me say in class that connections to data from the assimilation activity are particularly important, and that's because the team's ability to trust the persona depends heavily on that data. Personas that are disconnected from the data or unsupported are harder to defend and rally around.

Here are some examples:

- [two example personas]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/pdfs/example_personas.pdf) from the [Persona Lifecycle book](https://smile.amazon.com/Essential-Persona-Lifecycle-Building-Personas/dp/0123814189?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=persona%20lifecycle&qid=1487194670&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1).

# Persona Assignment

Your group must generate 2 personas and present foundation documents (descriptions like on the [CTA personas]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/02/CTA-Personas/) page) for both. You must also "show your work" - provide pictures of your data and assumption documenting and assimilating activities (like [these from class]({{ site.baseurl}}/2017/02/Persona-activity-photos/) and be sure to include references to that data when describing your personas. You will also list skeletons on your way to deciding which personas to generate, and you must provide those as well.

## Due Date

March 1

## Deliverables

1. 2 complete persona documents

3. list of skeletons and how you decided their priority

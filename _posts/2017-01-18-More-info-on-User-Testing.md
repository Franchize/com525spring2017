Today in class we reviewed the [introduction to user testing]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/01/Basic-Methods-of-UX/) and tried to write user tests for the CTA website or mobile app. People had questions about how to choose users, how to choose tasks, what can we say to people, what does it mean to have a script, etc. Now that you're curious and you care a little more, I can give you some readings. Check these out before class on Monday.

# The Short Version

[9 Steps for Creating the Perfect User Test](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2013/05/02/9-steps-to-creating-the-perfect-user-test/) - blog series from expert Jessica DuVerneay

# The Long Version

[The Handbook](https://www.dropbox.com/s/is6clbyq4ftkz8a/UsabilityTestingHandbook.pdf?dl=0) is the most popular guidebook, though it's getting dated. Chapter 8, especially, will be helpful at this point.

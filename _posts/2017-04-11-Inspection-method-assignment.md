Choose an [inspection method]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/03/UX-without-users/) that makes sense for your system or service, and run an evaluation. Remember, not all inspection methods are appropriate for all UX goals. Don't choose cognitive walkthough just because you watched a 6-minute video about it. Choose a  method that makes sense for your system and what you want to understand about its UX.

# Due Date

* Report
	* why you chose this inspection method
	* notes from the inspection (e.g., a cognitive walkthrough table like I wrote on the board)
	* takeaways from the inspection (i.e., what does this tell you about the design of your system or service?)

Monday we talked about [personas]({{site.baseurl}}/{% post_url 2017-02-06-Introducing-personas %}), and today we're going to try do an activity that gets us started in creating personas.

# Identify participants 

For our purposes, it's everyone in class.

# Clarify business, brand, and UX goals

## Business goals

- Often growth and/or revenue
- Goals expressed in numbers are easier to measure (e.g., increase subscribers by 20%)

## Brand goals

how the product should influence perception of the brand

## UX goals

"Try writing these as quotes you would like to hear coming out of your users ’mouths after
they see your new product or service — for example, 'Wow, I didn’t know that I could fi nd
information about all of my accounts in one place!'" (Adlin & Pruitt, 2010, p. 13)

# Categories of users

- roles
- goals
- segments

Often how the company already talks about users.

# Assumption sticky notes

each note contains 

1. Person
2. Goal, activity, action, or problem

Examples

- Teen looking for games to play online with friends.
- Mom trying to find educational games for her 5-year-old.

# Sticky note assimilation

Like [affinity diagramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram)

1. Put user category labels on individual papers or sections of the wall
1. Put sticky notes on papers
2. Look for patterns in sticky notes, and put similar ones together
3. Take a photo of the clusters
4. Re-assimilate by "I want" or "I need" statements
5. Find categories

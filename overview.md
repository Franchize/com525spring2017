# Course Description This goal treats UX design as an ongoing process throughout the full product life cycle, and developing the human-computer interface is not something to be done at the last minute, when the "rest of the system" is finished. 
Class time will be split between content-based lectures and in-class exercises to demonstrate techniques and principles and to practice the skills being presented. The part of class time used for lectures will be devoted to highlighting course materials, questions, and discussion. The in-class exercises will be an initial opportunity for experience with the UX development lifecycle activities. 
Outside of the classroom, students will acquire more in-depth hands-on experience in applying these skills and techniques in a semester-long team project. In this project, students will develop a usable interaction design for their own application system.
# Universality
The process, principles, and guidelines are universal and applicable to any kind of design that involves interaction between humans and non-human systems in the broadest sense. The material of this course applies not just to GUIs and the Web but to all kinds of interaction styles and devices, including ATMs, refrigerators, elevator buttons, road signs, ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, and everyday objects.

# Hands-on Approach
This course takes a practical, applied, hands-on approach, based on the application of established best practices, principles, and proven methods to ensure a quality user experience.
 The main course goal is for you to master the development activities of the UX lifecycle process.  You are exposed to each activity in several ways.  First you read about it in the book, then the instructor will review the highlights in lectures.  Then you get initial hands-on practice in a scaled-down classroom situation via these in-class exercises. Finally, you will apply them in a more realistic hands-on situation through your semester-long team project assignments.  
In the development process we draw on real-world engineering concepts of cost-effectiveness – making things as good as the resources permit, but not necessarily perfect.
# Class Policies

## Due Dates

Due dates for all assignments are firm, and no late assignments will be accepted.

## Attendance You will not be graded directly on attendance. You are adults and are expected to attend every class.  Beyond the occasional need to be absent from class for a good reason, please consider that much of the learning for the course occurs in class. You cannot participate in this learning if you are not present, and you cannot complete the [in-class exercises]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments) if you're absent.
If you have to miss class for an extended period due to a protracted illness or similar reason, I will treat your needs as a special case, and I will do what I can to help you survive.
 ## Special Needs PolicyReasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in Life Sciences Room 252, telephone 312.567.5744 or [disabilities@iit.edu](mailto:disabilities@iit.edu).
## A Note on Academic HonestyWork you submit must be your own. Refer to the Code of Academic Honesty in the Student Handbook for details concerning sanctions. If you need help documenting sources appropriately, please visit the Writing Center (Siegel Hall 232-233).
